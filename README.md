The code in run_analysis.r creates a tidy dataset containing 40 rows and 66 columns
based on the files in folder UCI HAR Dataset.

This set of data comes from th experiment on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
made by the following researchers:

Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.
activityrecognition@smartlab.ws

This set of data should be saved in ./data/UCI HAR Datasetfor the r script code to work.

The script does the follwing:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
variable for each activity and each subject.

The code contains comments explaining what is done to the data at each stage. 
I have not created a codebook as I beleive the comments in the code was sufficient and did
not want to create something completly irrelevant so I am looking forward to see co-student work 
to get inspired.
